Arduino-Powered Ultrasonic Fuel Level MonitorA simple yet effective solution for monitoring the fuel level in a heating oil tank using an Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and an I2C LCD display. This project provides real-time percentage readings, helping to avoid unexpected run-outs.üöÄ OverviewThis project was created to provide a non-invasive way to measure the amount of fuel remaining in a standard home heating oil tank. An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted at the top of the tank measures the distance to the surface of the oil. An Arduino board then calculates this distance into a percentage of fullness and displays it on a 16x2 LCD screen. A reset button is included to easily restart the display.‚ú® FeaturesReal-Time Monitoring: Get up-to-the-second fuel level readings.Simple LCD Display: A clear 16x2 character display shows the fuel percentage.Easy Calibration: Easily adjust settings in the code to match your specific tank dimensions.Non-Invasive: The ultrasonic sensor measures distance without needing to be submerged in the fuel.Reset Functionality: A push button allows for a quick reset of the system.üõ†Ô∏è Components RequiredComponentQuantityNotesArduino Uno (or Nano)1The microcontroller brain of the project.HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor1For measuring distance.16x2 I2C LCD Display1To display the fuel level.Momentary Push Button1For the reset function.10k Ohm Resistor1A pull-down resistor for the button.Breadboard1For prototyping the circuit.Jumper WiresSeveralTo connect all the components.Waterproof Enclosure1(Optional) To protect the electronics.üîå Wiring & SchematicsThe components are wired according to the following pinout.

In the IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... and search for LiquidCrystal_I2C by Frank de Brabander.Upload the Code:Open the .ino sketch file from this repository.Connect your Arduino to your computer.Select the correct Board and Port from the Tools menu.Click the "Upload" button.üìè CalibrationTo get accurate readings, you must calibrate the sensor for your specific tank. Open the code and modify these two constants:// The total height of your tank in inches.
const float TANK_HEIGHT = 27.0; 

// The distance from the sensor to the top of the oil when the tank is full (in inches).
const float SENSOR_OFFSET = 2.0; 
TANK_HEIGHT: Measure the total internal height of your fuel tank in inches.SENSOR_OFFSET: Mount the sensor and, with a full tank, measure the distance from the sensor's measurement face to the surface of the oil. This accounts for the space between the sensor and the maximum fuel level.After updating these values, re-upload the code to your Arduino.üí° UsageOnce powered on, the device will automatically begin displaying the fuel level percentage. The reading will update every second.Press the reset button at any time to clear the display and restart the measurement process.üîÆ Future ImprovementsWi-Fi Connectivity: Use an ESP8266 or ESP32 to send data to a web server or mobile app.Data Logging: Store historical data on an SD card to track fuel usage over time.Low-Level Alerts: Program the device to trigger an LED or buzzer when the fuel level drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 20%).üìÑ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.
